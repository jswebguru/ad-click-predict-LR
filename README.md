# Ad-Click-Prediction

### Motivation
The main motivation behind the project is “Targeted Advertising”. At its most basic, targeted advertising can just mean that ads are chosen for their relevance to site content, in the assumption that they will then be relevant to the site audience as well. Online advertisers can use different methods to target a particular advertisement on the user based on its traits. Most of company do this as part of social media like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. But most of the times the process goes wrong and the advertisement does not reach its target audience because it is sent out without actually understanding the probability of the occurring click.

### Problem statement

Publicizing is a multi-billion-dollar industry that goes about as a scaffold among organizations and their clients. While the vast majority are aware of the promotions around them, they represent the intensity of those advertisements and the impact of publicizing all in all. Research proposes that basically making somebody mindful of items, occasions, and brands expands the chances of that individual really purchasing those items, going to those occasions, or supporting those brands. Further, if an advertisement catches a man's thoughtfulness regarding the degree that he or she has a prompt, positive response to it, those chances of direct item commitment spikes significantly.

In this project, we are going to work on an advertising dataset, indicating whether or not a particular internet user has clicked on an Advertisement.

The goal is to predict if a user would click on an advertisement based on the features of the user.
Few assumptions made as a part of this project is: 

1)	User taken into consideration are between the age group of 19 to 61. 
2)	There is almost equal ratio of male and female internet users. 
3)	The ad topic is limited to what is given in the dataset.
